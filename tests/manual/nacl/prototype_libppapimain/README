This test prototypes an approach for preserving the "Qt main" pattern
where the application provides a main() implementation which start Qt.

To accomplish this Qt must call PpapiPluginMain() at some point during
startup. Currently this seems to only be possible fromt he main application
executable. Calling PpapiPluginMain() froma shared library results in a
verification error. ("failed to load code from shared object: Invalid argument")


Subdirs:
    lib: a library
    main: a main nexe

Deploy:

$NACL_SDK_ROOT/tools/create_nmf.py main.nexe -s . -o main.nmf && $NACL_SDK_ROOT/tools/create_html.py main.nmf && python -m SimpleHTTPServer
